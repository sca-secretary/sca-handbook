# 3-3-9 Advancing Equity: Continuing Education Funding
This funding, established in 2021, promotes the diversification of the larger archival community through the support of continuing education. The award provides financial support to individual archivists of color for archives-related training and professional development, or to organizations proposing educational events for archivists or archives volunteers centered on the records of communities of color.

Community organizations in California, or SCA members in good standing and not enrolled in a degree-granting program, who have limited or no access to institutional funding for continuing education, may apply. Up to $1,000 may be awarded per event, with $2,000 allotted annually for this award.

Applications are considered as-received, and awarded based on the availability of annual funding. If multiple individual applications are received for the same event, or for events in a similar time frame, the Awards Committee will select one or more recipients based on the merits of each application as communicated in the submitted personal statement and letter of recommendation._
