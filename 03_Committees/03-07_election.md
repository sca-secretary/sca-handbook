# 3-7 Election Committee

## General Description

The Election Committee conducts annual elections for offices vacant in a given year. Alice Sturgis’s _The Standard Code of Parliamentary Procedure_ gives detailed instructions for the election process. These should serve as a guide to be followed as closely as possible. The election procedure, terms of office, and general duties of the Board are described in Bylaws IV.

The selection procedure and term of office are described in Bylaws IV.5.
